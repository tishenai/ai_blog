This is a **hidden** post (stronger than `draft`).

- **Production:** This page is **never generated**, so the URL will always return **404**.
- It will **never** appear in `/posts` listing.
- It will **not** be included in **RSS**, **sitemap**, or **LLMs.txt**.
- Search engines will **not** index this page.

This status is intended for internal notes or permanently hidden pages.

If you really want to render hidden pages locally for debugging in a non-production environment, set `ALLOW_HIDDEN=true`.
